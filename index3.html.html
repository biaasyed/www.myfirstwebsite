    <p><b>I love seeing the tiny details in everyday things that people normally overlook. When I present them though the lens of a camera, I usually get a response along the lines of “Wow, I never noticed that before!”

    </b></p>
    <p><b>Photography has become the main outlet for my self-expression. It relaxes me, it helps me escape from the stress of daily life and the boredom of routine. It calms my nerves and allows me to be present to the moment. Photography is like meditation 
        for me, and it makes me happy.</b></p>
