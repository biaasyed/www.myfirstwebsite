   <p><blockquote>
    "Photography is the art, application, and practice of creating
     durable images by recording light, either electronically by means
      of an image sensor, or chemically by means of a light-sensitive material such a
      s photographic film.<p>"Every art form has its unique advantages. Even if you�re already an artist or love working on DIY projects, you�re bound to discover something new in photography.

      Photography as a hobby can be instantly gratifying, especially if you find the perfect moment to capture. It can challenge you in many ways, depending on the genre you choose.
      
      For example, macro photography can help you notice more beauty in details.</p>
